seaborn==0.9.0

# One of seaborn's deps was pandas>=0.15.2, and naturally it tries to pull
# the latest version (0.25.0) which doesn't have a wheel built for my python
# version (3.5, or cp35m). Pinning a version with a compiled wheel helps.
#
# TLDR: If you see pip trying to build a wheel locally (and a bunch of errors
# along the way b/c you don't have wheels and Cython packages to do that),
# look for the latest version with a wheel built for your python version here:
